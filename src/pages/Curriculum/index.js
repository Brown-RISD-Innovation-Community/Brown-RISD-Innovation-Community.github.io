            Workshops will be held almost every week, led by a BRIC founding
            member. <strong>Each week has a theme</strong> (eg. Graphic Design,
            Data Analysis) and there will be{" "}
            <strong>
              two workshops related to that theme on different days of the week
            </strong>
            . Both the workshops will cover complimentary topics, but won't rely
            on each other. For example, in the Graphic Design week, there will
            be two workshops: <strong>UI/UX Design</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Branding and Packaging.</strong>

            <strong>
              Every other week, we will release a design challenge.
            </strong>{" "}
            The challenge prompt will be broad enough for students to innovate
            the way they want, but specific enough so students can utilize the
            skills they learned from previous workshops. We will maintain{" "}
            <strong>
              a spreadsheet of projects that students are working on so that
              members can collaborate with each other
            </strong>
            . People who donâ€™t attend workshops can still participate in design
            challenges.

            Halfway through the semester, we will close registration.{" "}
            <strong>
              Registered BRIC members will work on a bigger, more ambitious
              project, through the remainder of the semester.
            </strong>{" "}
            As before, we will maintain a spreadsheet of running projects so
            members can collaborate and form teams.{" "}
            <strong>
              Projects can be anything! Small, big, complex, simple, sciencey,
              artsy, tech, non-tech.
            </strong>{" "}
            We want to move away from only product and service based conceptions
            of innovation. Here, BRIC will act as a platform for students to
            collaborate and create across College Hill!

            BRIC Mentors are passionate, innovative students at RISD and Brown
            who have experience pursuing interdisciplinary projects and ideas.
            <strong>
              Mentors will be paired with upto 2 student groups based on shared
              interests and experience, and will guide them in project
              development and execution.
            </strong>{" "}
            Mentors will also provide career advice, can review portfolios and
            connect mentees to other students in their network.
